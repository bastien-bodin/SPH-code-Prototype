# SPH-code

First prototype for making SPH Simulations. Test with a Dam Break problem.
based on the work done by Goffin, Louis. "Development of a didactic SPH model." (2013).

It served as a playground to learn the bases of the SPH method.
For the current model, please go see the [CryoPy repository](https://github.com/bastien-bodin/CryoPy)
